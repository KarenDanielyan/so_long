So Long is a project from 42 School that involves creating a 2D game using the minilibx graphics library. The goal of this project is to create a game where the player has to navigate a character through a map while avoiding obstacles and collecting items.

## Usage
To use the so_long program, run it with a single argument:

```
./so_long map.ber
```
Where map.ber is the path to the map file. The program will then load the map and start the game.
